# caddy

A [Docker](https://docker.com) image for [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com). This image includes the [git](https://caddyserver.com/docs/http.git) plugin. Plugins can be configured via the [`plugins` build arg](#custom-plugins).

### License

This image is built from [source code](https://github.com/mholt/caddy). As such, it is subject to the project's [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/mholt/caddy/blob/baf6db5b570e36ea2fee30d50f879255a5895370/LICENSE.txt), but it neither contains nor is subject to [the EULA for Caddy's official binary distributions](https://github.com/mholt/caddy/blob/545fa844bbd188c1e5bff6926e5c410e695571a0/dist/EULA.txt).

## Proxy Configuration

The default behaviour is the same as previously, the configuration is taken from /etc/Caddyfile.

If Environment Variable `CADDY_GENERATE_CONFIG` is set to `yes` or `true` the configuration file `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` is autogenerated using a simple template that lookup environment variables.

The templating supports defining multiple hostnames and multiple filters and proxies for each hostname.
Example environment variables:

```sh
CADDY_GENERATE_CONFIG=yes
CADDY_ENTRY0_HOSTNAME=foo.bar.baz
CADDY_ENTRY0_TLS_MODE=self_signed
CADDY_ENTRY0_AUTH0_PATH=/
CADDY_ENTRY0_AUTH0_USERNAME=foo
CADDY_ENTRY0_AUTH0_PASSWORD=bar
CADDY_ENTRY0_PROXY0_PATH=/
CADDY_ENTRY0_PROXY0_DEST='http://localhost:8080'
CADDY_ENTRY0_FILTER0_PATH=/
CADDY_ENTRY0_FILTER0_CONTENT_TYPE='text/html.*'
CADDY_ENTRY0_FILTER0_SEARCH_PATTERN="=\" /"
CADDY_ENTRY0_FILTER0_REPLACEMENT="=\" /mesos/"
CADDY_ENTRY0_PROXY0_WEBSOCKET=yes
CADDY_ENTRY0_PROXY0_WITHOUT="/mesos"
CADDY_ENTRY0_PROXY0_TRANSPARENT="yes"
```

Which will create the following configuration::
```
foo.bar.baz {
  filter rule {
    path /
    content_type text/html.*
    search_pattern =" /
    replacement =" /mesos/
  }
  basicauth / foo bar
  tls self_signed
  log stdout
  errors stderr
  proxy / http://localhost:8080 {
    without /mesos
    websocket
    transparent
  }
}
```

For other definitions use `CADDY_ENTRY1` `CADDY_ENTRY2` etc and for filters and proxies you can also increment the id to have multiple definitions.

Custom configuration can be inserted using `CADDY_ENTRY0_CUSTOM0` and each line will be displayed in order at the bottom of the configuration of the hostname.

## Getting Started

```sh
$ docker run -d -p 2015:2015 abiosoft/caddy
```

Point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:2015`.

> Be aware! If you don't bind mount the location certificates are saved to, you may hit Let's Encrypt rate [limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/) rending further certificate generation or renewal disallowed (for a fixed period)! See "Saving Certificates" below!

### Saving Certificates

Save certificates on host machine to prevent regeneration every time container starts.
Let's Encrypt has [rate limit](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/rate-limits-for-lets-encrypt/6769).
```sh
$ docker run -d \
    -v $(pwd)/Caddyfile:/etc/Caddyfile \
    -v $HOME/.caddy:/root/.caddy \
    -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
    abiosoft/caddy
```


Here, `/root/.caddy` is the location *inside* the container where caddy will save certificates.

Additionally, you can use an *environment variable* to define the exact location caddy should save generated certificates:

```sh
$ docker run -d \
    -e "CADDYPATH=/etc/caddycerts" \
    -v $HOME/.caddy:/etc/caddycerts \
    -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
    abiosoft/caddy
```

Above, we utilize the `CADDYPATH` environment variable to define a different location inside the container for
certificates to be stored. This is probably the safest option as it ensures any future docker image changes don't interfere with your ability to save certificates!

### PHP
`:[<version>-]php` variant of this image bundles PHP-FPM alongside essential php extensions and [composer](https://getcomposer.org). e.g. `:php`, `:0.10.10-php`
```sh
$ docker run -d -p 2015:2015 abiosoft/caddy:php
```
Point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:2015` and you will see a php info page.

##### Local php source

Replace `/path/to/php/src` with your php sources directory.
```sh
$ docker run -d -v /path/to/php/src:/srv -p 2015:2015 abiosoft/caddy:php
```
Point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:2015`.

##### Note
Your `Caddyfile` must include the line `on startup php-fpm7`. For Caddy to be PID 1 in the container, php-fpm7 could not be started.

### Using git sources

Caddy can serve sites from git repository using [git](https://caddyserver.com/docs/http.git) plugin.

##### Create Caddyfile

Replace `github.com/abiosoft/webtest` with your repository.

```sh
$ printf "0.0.0.0\nroot src\ngit github.com/abiosoft/webtest" > Caddyfile
```

##### Run the image

```sh
$ docker run -d -v $(pwd)/Caddyfile:/etc/Caddyfile -p 2015:2015 abiosoft/caddy
```
Point your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:2015`.

## Custom plugins

You can build a docker image with custom plugins by specifying `plugins` build arg as shown in the example below.
```
docker build --build-arg \
    plugins=filemanager,git,linode \
    github.com/abiosoft/caddy-docker.git
```

## Usage

#### Default Caddyfile

The image contains a default Caddyfile.

```
0.0.0.0
browse
fastcgi / 127.0.0.1:9000 php # php variant only
on startup php-fpm7 # php variant only
```
The last 2 lines are only present in the php variant.

#### Paths in container

Caddyfile: `/etc/Caddyfile`

Sites root: `/srv`

#### Using local Caddyfile and sites root

Replace `/path/to/Caddyfile` and `/path/to/sites/root` accordingly.

```sh
$ docker run -d \
    -v /path/to/sites/root:/srv \
    -v path/to/Caddyfile:/etc/Caddyfile \
    -p 2015:2015 \
    abiosoft/caddy
```

### Let's Encrypt Auto SSL
**Note** that this does not work on local environments.

Use a valid domain and add email to your Caddyfile to avoid prompt at runtime.
Replace `mydomain.com` with your domain and `user@host.com` with your email.
```
mydomain.com
tls user@host.com
```

##### Run the image

You can change the the ports if ports 80 and 443 are not available on host. e.g. 81:80, 444:443

```sh
$ docker run -d \
    -v $(pwd)/Caddyfile:/etc/Caddyfile \
    -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
    abiosoft/caddy
```
